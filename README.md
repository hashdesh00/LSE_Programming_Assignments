# LSE_Programming_Assignments

## Brief Overview

This repository showcases a collection of programming assignments completed during my studies in Financial Mathematics and Statistics at the London School of Economics (LSE). Utilizing both **R** and **Python**, these projects focus on applying quantitative methods and computational tools to real-world financial and data analysis problems. Key areas include:

- **Portfolio Selection**: Constructed optimized investment portfolios using mean-variance analysis to balance risk and return.
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Analyzed education outcomes by identifying significant covariates through data analysis techniques.
- **Risk and Financial Modelling**: Developed models to assess financial risks and simulate asset price dynamics.
- **Submarine Network Algorithms**: Utilized data structures and graph algorithms to determine feasible journeys and travel times within a submarine network.
- **Computational Finance**: Modeled financial derivatives and explored pricing methodologies such as Monte Carlo simulations and the Black-Scholes model.

Each project emphasizes a combination of theoretical understanding and practical implementation, reflecting my ability to apply data analysis and financial modeling techniques to diverse problems.
