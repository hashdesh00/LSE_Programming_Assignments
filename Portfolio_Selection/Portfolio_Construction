## Question 2: Constructing a Portfolio on a Rolling Window Basis

### Objective:
The objective is to create a portfolio consisting of 10 selected stocks, 
adjusting the portfolio weights every `I` trading days using historical return data over the past `D` days. 
The strategy seeks to maximize risk-adjusted returns while maintaining stable portfolio weights and avoiding investment 
in any risk-free assets.

---

### 1. Initial Setup:
The portfolio is initialized at time `t0`, with an equal allocation of weights to all the selected stocks. 
The portfolio weights are then adjusted every `I` trading days, using the stock returns over the previous `D` days.
These weights are optimized to achieve a target portfolio return while minimizing portfolio variance.

---

### 2. Calculating Rolling Mean Returns:
- The rolling mean return for each stock is computed using the past `D` days of return data. 
This provides a time-windowed estimate of the average return for each stock in the portfolio.
- The rolling mean returns serve as the basis for adjusting the portfolio weights at every rebalancing point.
  
---

### 3. Weight Adjustments and Optimization:
- At every rebalancing point `t = t0 + nI`, we adjust the portfolio weights based on the historical returns over the past `D` trading days. 
- The weights are optimized by solving a quadratic optimization problem with two key constraints:
  1. The sum of the portfolio weights must equal 1.
  2. The target return must be achieved using the optimized weights.

- The optimization problem is formulated as a quadratic programming problem, 
where the objective is to minimize portfolio variance while satisfying the above constraints.

---

### 4. Covariance Matrix Regularization:
- The covariance matrix of the asset returns over the past `D` days is used in the optimization process.
A small shrinkage term (epsilon) is applied to the covariance matrix to ensure it remains positive semi-definite and stable.
  
- This regularization step ensures the optimization is not overly sensitive to noise in the covariance estimates, 
especially during periods of market volatility.

---

### 5. Execution of the Investment Strategy:
- The portfolio is rebalanced every `I` trading days.
For each day within the `I`-day period, the weights remain constant,
and the portfolio returns are calculated based on the stock prices for that day.
- The portfolio return on each day is the weighted sum of the returns of the individual stocks.

---

### 6. Performance Metrics:
- **Annualized Sharpe Ratio**: This ratio measures the risk-adjusted return of the portfolio over the entire investment period. 
It is calculated by annualizing the portfolio's daily returns, which are adjusted for volatility.

  \[
  \text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{\sqrt{252} \times \text{Average Daily Return}}{\text{Standard Deviation of Daily Returns}}
  \]

- **Average Sum of Absolute Changes in Weights (AvsAchg)**: This metric measures the stability of portfolio weights.
It calculates the average sum of absolute changes in the weights between rebalancing periods. 
A lower AvsAchg indicates more stable weights, leading to lower transaction costs.

  \[
  \text{AvsAchg} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t} \|w_{t+1} - w_t\|_1
  \]

---

### 7. Sensitivity Analysis:
To understand the effect of each parameter (`t0`, `D`, `I`, `x`),
a sensitivity analysis was performed by systematically varying these parameters across defined ranges.
The Sharpe ratio and AvsAchg were computed for each combination of parameter values.

- **Parameter Ranges:**
  - `t0`: Starting point of the investment period (e.g., 250 to 2250 days).
  - `D`: Window length used to compute mean returns (e.g., 60 to 120 days).
  - `I`: Rebalancing interval (e.g., 60 to 120 days).
  - `x`: Target return scaling factor (e.g., 0.5 to 2.5).

- **Key Insights:**
  - Longer windows for calculating the rolling mean returns (higher `D`) tended to stabilize the portfolio,
but reduced responsiveness to market conditions.
  - The parameter `I` (rebalancing interval) had little impact on the Sharpe ratio but significantly affected the AvsAchg. 
More frequent rebalancing led to higher transaction costs.
  - The parameter `x` (target return scaling) did not significantly affect the Sharpe ratio within the tested range,
but impacted the portfolio weights, especially for higher values.

---

### 8. Optimal Parameter Selection:
Through the sensitivity analysis, the optimal parameter set that provided the best balance between a high Sharpe ratio and a low AvsAchg,
was identified as:

- `t0 = 500`
- `D = 60`
- `I = 70`
- `x = 1.2`

This combination resulted in an annualized Sharpe ratio of **0.74** and an AvsAchg of **9.9789**,
suggesting a favorable trade-off between risk-adjusted returns and portfolio stability.

---

### 9. Conclusion:
The rolling window portfolio construction strategy effectively adjusts weights based on historical return data,
allowing the portfolio to adapt to changing market conditions. 
By fine-tuning the parameters, an optimal strategy was identified that maximizes returns while minimizing portfolio rebalancing costs. 
This approach highlights the importance of balancing stability and responsiveness in portfolio management.
